Constructs
    / use extend to build 'classes'
    / pass static props and instance props (to the constructors prototype)
    / the 'init' prototype property is called when a constructor is instantiated
    / when using inheritance, call the base class consturctor via... can.Construct.prototype.init.apply(this, arguments);
        // the way to access 'prototype' is vitally important
        // the way to use 'apply' is vitally important
        // the way to use 'arguments' is vitally important
